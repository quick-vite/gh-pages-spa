## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting a security vulnerability is done via [filing a security bug report](https://github.com/quick-vite/gh-pages-spa/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=security_bug_report.md&title=), please provide us with as much details as you can.

Your report will be reviewed and you can expect a detailed explanation stating how we'll address the situation.  
We will provide a reason if we decide to ignore/not pick up this vulnerability, or if it's not applicable.
